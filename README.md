Story Maker
===========

Story Maker is a tool to create interactive graphic adventures (classical point ant click games).

I think that this type of games is a great medium to tell stories and the new mobile devices provides a big opportunity to rebird and evolve them.

By creating Story Maker, I want to create a platform to tell stories, interactive stories with modern graphics, animations and music.

### The Goddess Robbery

Story Maker is currently under development and is not ready for production. The Goddess Robbery is a test game created to show the features of Story Maker.

The Goddess Robbery is currently availabler for Android devices in the Google Play Store.
